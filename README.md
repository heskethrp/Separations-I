 first course in the ChE separations Sequence

##  Syllabus
Course No.	CHE06 312

## Course Description -
Prerequisites:  Prerequisites: MATH 01230 minimum grade of C- and (ENGR 01341 minimum grade of C- or ENGR 01342 minimum grade of C-) or CHE 06241 minimum grade of C- and (CHE 06202 minimum grade of C- or CHE 06203 minimum grade of C- ).

This course describes modes of diffusion of mass and chemical composition. This course includes mass transfer analysis; molecular diffusion in gases, liquids, and solids and convective mass transfer. It will have an introduction to equilibrium-staged mass transfer operations such as: absorption/stripping, extraction/leaching operations. Demonstrations, laboratories and computer simulations may be integrated throughout this course..

- Explain to another ChE student how the terms rate of mass transfer and phase equilibrium are applicable to a separation process
- Define the terms diffusion and convection and show how they are used to predict mass transfer
- Develop a model of diffusion in a Stefan tube can be used to determine gas phase diffusivity from experimental data of liquid height.
- Solve chemical engineering problems using numerical methods that include python and COMSOL.
- Determine the time required to coat Silicon on a spherical particle to obtain a thickness of 10 microns using chemical vapor deposition.
- Develop a model to determine the time required to regenerate a cracking catalyst that is fouled with carbon in the outer 1/3 of the particle radius.

## Assignments -
Submit pdf and polymath file (Remember make plots using excel)

### From the Syllabus:

### Computers:  Homework Assignments using Computers

a) Show how the problem was set up for the computer program using hand written equations.  This includes a diagram of the physical dimensions of the problem and the equations and known values that will be input into the program.

b) Show sample calculations (with units) for each spreadsheet or POLYMATH calculation on engineering paper. 

c) Do not printout raw data from data acquisition experiments.  A summary of the data in the form of a table and/or a graphical presentation of this data is sufficient unless otherwise requested from the professor.

d)  For homework requiring Python, the following additional printouts are required:
<ol>
i) The iPython notebook *.ipynb file.  This file must have in separate rectangles the answers to each of the questions. 

ii) A summary table of the iterations required for a solution and any trials required for the solution.  The solution should be identified in the pdf and boxed.  It should not just be a number on the printout.  If requested the program file may need to be uploaded on blackboard. 

iii)  Do not use an analytical solution as an aid to obtain a numerical solution to an identical problem.  The goal in this class is to compare the analytical solution to a numerical solution to gain an understanding of the capabilities of numerical solutions.
</ol>
e) For homework requiring ASPEN:  i) A summary table of the solution ii) a process flow diagram
iii) electronic file uploaded on blackboard or otherwise instructed by professor.

f) For homework requiring COMSOL:  i) handwritten setup of the problem showing geometry and equations ii) required graphs and tables iii) electronic *.mph file uploaded on blackboard or otherwise instructed by professor

### Electronic Submissions

All answers submitted electronically (e.g. Canvas) must be in a single pdf file for the entire assignment.  For example if there are 3 problems, then there will be 3 problem answers in the one pdf file that are placed in the order assigned.  Hand calculations can be scanned and inserted into the document.  All material including required graphs, must be placed in consecutive pages.  Beyond the initial electronic document, points will be subtracted for each electronic file that is required to be opened to see the work of the student.  If using MS word as the electronic document, convert to pdf before submitting.  Please do not upload a zip file since feedback can not be given using Canvas tools.
